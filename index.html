I have a background in Sports Science and have always been interested in how the human body works and how to improve physical performance. I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to improve our lives and make things easier. I am currently studying Computer Science at Malmö University and am looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
